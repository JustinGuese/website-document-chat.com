title: 'Instructions: How can I use ChatGPT with documents?'
---

# Introduction

Advanced language models like ChatGPT undoubtedly possess impressive capabilities in generating human-like text and answering questions. However, it's crucial to understand that these models rely on general knowledge and lack access to context-specific information. Furthermore, they often operate on older knowledge bases, meaning they may not have access to the latest information.

Fortunately, there's a solution to this problem: you can upload your own documents, thereby expanding ChatGPT's knowledge base. By providing specific information and expertise through documents, you can ensure ChatGPT has access to current and contextually relevant information.

## But What About Data Security and GDPR?

But what about data security? This question is paramount, especially when considering uploading your own documents and information into ChatGPT. It's important to note that companies like OpenAI and similar providers use every input fed into their models as training material. While this can contribute to improving AI capabilities, there's a risk of confidential information, including company secrets, being revealed.

> Tip:
> To avoid your data being used by American AI providers like OpenAI, consider running a "self-hosted" AI model. This requires a server with an Nvidia GPU and a corresponding "torch" setup. For DIY solutions, the open-source project https://ollama.com is recommended. Alternatively, a German AI provider, such as https://document-chat.com or https://datafortress.cloud, is an option. document-chat.com also offers project-based organization, useful sharing/team features, and more!

Some knowledge workers report that ChatGPT significantly increases their productivity. However, companies like JP Morgan and Verizon have blocked ChatGPT due to the risks to confidential data. Our analysis indicates that 4.7% of employees have inserted confidential data into ChatGPT.

## Tutorial: Using ChatGPT with Documents

This tutorial will show you how to use ChatGPT to upload, analyze, and interact with documents. Follow these steps to get started:

#### Step 1: Subscribe to ChatGPT Plus or use ChatGPT for Enterprise

To utilize the document processing feature, you need either a ChatGPT Plus subscription or access to ChatGPT for Enterprise. ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month and gives you advanced features like document processing.

#### Step 2: Select the Desired Document

Once you have a ChatGPT Plus subscription or ChatGPT for Enterprise access, select the document you wish to upload. Ensure the document is in a supported file format, such as PDF or other common formats.

#### Step 3: Upload the Document

Click the corresponding option within the ChatGPT user interface to upload the selected document. Wait until the document upload is complete.

#### Step 4: Interact with ChatGPT

After the document is uploaded, you can directly interact with ChatGPT. Ask questions about the document's content, request a summary, or ask for analyses or trends based on the data within the document.

#### Step 5: Utilize Advanced Features

ChatGPT also offers advanced features like writing and executing Python code, processing file uploads, and assisting with data analysis. Verify your settings to ensure you have enabled the advanced features.

#### Step 6: Maintain Data Security

It's essential to prioritize data security when uploading documents to ChatGPT. Remember that OpenAI and similar providers may use every input to their models as training data. Therefore, only upload non-confidential information or encrypted data to minimize the risk of data breaches.
