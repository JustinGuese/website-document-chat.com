## Use Cases

**1. Support in Customer Service and Sales:**

- Sales representatives can ask the bot about current offers, discounts, or specific product details and receive an immediate response including the relevant source.
- Customer service teams have direct access to manuals and support guidelines to answer customer questions faster and more accurately.

**2. Interactive Knowledge Base for Confluence and SharePoint:**

- Employees no longer need to scroll through dozens of pages – the bot knows all documents in Confluence, SharePoint, and other platforms and provides answers to queries like "What steps are necessary to implement Product X?" or "What is the quality assurance process?".

**3. Quick Access to Email Correspondence for Management:**

- Executives can ask questions like "When was our last meeting with Client XY?" or "What was the main point of the last email to Project Z?". The bot searches emails and provides the answer along with the relevant document, saving valuable time.

**4. Automated Document Creation Based on Existing Knowledge:**

- The bot can suggest content such as technical documentation, project overviews, or even personalized emails based on existing company knowledge, which can then be further refined through manual editing.

**5. Compliance and Audit Preparations:**

- Compliance teams have chat access to all regulatory guidelines and compliance documents, such as GDPR guidelines or BaFin requirements, and can quickly clarify specific questions. This is especially useful during audit preparations to quickly answer questions about compliance status.

**6. Integration into Project Management Tools (e.g., Jira):**

- Project teams can ask the bot about the status of a specific project or the next planned steps. The bot accesses information from Jira, Asana, and other project management platforms.

**7. Acceleration of Onboarding Processes:**

- New employees have direct access to all relevant manuals and processes with **document-chat** and can ask basic questions about workflows, IT policies, and company culture via chat. This facilitates onboarding and helps new employees become productive faster.

**8. Support for Internal Communication and Department Coordination:**

- **document-chat** can consolidate relevant internal updates, regulations, or instructions from various departments and serve as a central knowledge source accessible to all departments.

**9. Maintenance and Support – Simplified Requests for Technicians and Service Teams:**

- Technical teams can ask specific questions like "How do I install software version 2.5 on device X?" or "What maintenance steps are necessary for machine Y?". The bot accesses technical manuals and maintenance documentation and provides them with source references.

These use cases show only a part of the possibilities of how **document-chat** can make your company knowledge lively and interactively usable. With customized adjustments, **document-chat** can be tailored to your specific needs and company structures.

## Enable Executives to Access Relevant Information Directly

Imagine the CEO can ask the bot: "When was our last meeting with Client XY?" or "What was the price in the offer for Project Z again?".
